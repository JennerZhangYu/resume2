<h1>Resume</h1>
<h2>I am a student of Ningbo City Vocational and technical college. At present, I am a sophomore. My grades are relatively ordinary. I am personally interested in sports.</h2>
<p>I am most interested in physical education among the courses set up by the school at present. At the same time, I am also interested in English and programming. Physical education is my personal hobby. For me, physical education is a process of relaxing and liberating pressure. Programming and English are my professional courses. I am a computer major student. English is a basis for learning programming, This can make me better learn the content of programming class.</p>
<p>My strength is that I will invest a lot of energy and time in learning what I am interested in and be responsible for my homework, so most of my homework will be completed and submitted on time, but my weakness is also obvious. My weakness is that I don't like to ask about the difficult parts of my homework, so the time to do my homework will be relatively long and take up a lot of time. </p>
<p>For my shortcomings, I will change myself, get rid of the bad habit of not asking questions, improve my learning efficiency, complete the quality of homework and shorten the time occupied by homework. And record the process of class and record the screen in class to facilitate subsequent homework and review.</p>
