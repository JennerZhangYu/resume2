 <h1 <h1 align="center">It project</h1></h1>
<p>My IT project is to build a website to store personal information, describe my personal information and give future employers access and understanding. The software needed for this project is a perfect personal information website.</p>
 <h1 <h1 align="center">Values and methods of completing this it project</h1></h1>
<p>The first core value of the project of establishing the website is authenticity, authenticity, reliability and high reliability. It is the first goal and core idea of our website to give visitors the most authentic information and facilitate their use. Authenticity is very important. For our website, when registrants learn to look at themselves truthfully, they know that they are not omnipotent. After they look at their strengths and weaknesses truthfully, they can look at problems more objectively. This is an test for registrants. We will verify the identity of the website registrants. Only after the official verification can we register through the inspection of the website. We will verify the website registrants through regular updates. This is the operation mode of our website.</p>
